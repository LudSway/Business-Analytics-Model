# Data Analysis and Modeling Script

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that performs data cleaning, imputation, feature engineering, and model training on a dataset. The script uses various techniques to prepare data for analysis and build a machine learning model to predict a target variable.

## Script Features

- **Data Loading**: Reads data from an Excel file.
- **Data Examination**: Displays dataset snapshot and basic information.
- **Missing Values Handling**: Fills or imputes missing values.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and removes outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Normalizes and standardizes features.
- **Feature Selection**: Selects important features using a Random Forest classifier.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Linear Regression model on the processed data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

Script Usage
Update File Path: Edit the file_path variable in the script to point to your dataset file location.

Review Output:

The script will display information about the dataset and perform various preprocessing tasks.
It will generate visualizations and save cleaned data and model results to Excel files.
Code Structure
Data Loading: Reads data from Cleaned Dataset.xlsx.
Data Examination: Uses print() to display dataset information and missing values.
Handling Missing Values: Fills or imputes missing values in numeric and categorical columns.
Outlier Detection: Uses IQR method to detect and remove outliers.
Feature Engineering: Applies normalization and standardization techniques.
Feature Selection: Uses Random Forest to select important features.
Visualization: Plots histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices.
Model Training: Trains a Linear Regression model on the processed data and evaluates its performance.
Files
